# Searching
## Aim
To search elemets for a user inputed array of data using linear search and binary search.
## Description
To search for an element from a given array of data, two algorithms can be used. One is linear search and the other is binary search. 
In linear search, the element to be found is checked with each and every element of the array untill the same element is found.
In binary search, the array of data is first sorted and then split from the middle. If the element is greater than the middle element then the first half of the array is neglected and the second half is the new array. If the element to be searched is less than the middle element then the first half of the array is considered the new array. The middle element of the new array is found and the same procedure is repeated untill the given element is found.
